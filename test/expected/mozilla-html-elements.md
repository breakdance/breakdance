This page lists all the [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.") [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element "elements: An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag:"). They are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind easily. Although this guide is written for those who are newer to coding, we intend it to be useful for anyone.

## Basic elements

Basic elements are the backbone of any HTML document. You'll see these elements in the source code for all web pages, following the doctype declaration, which is on the first line of the page. The doctype specifies which version of (X)HTML that page is using. Elements comprising the contents of a Web page are placed between the opening [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html "The HTML <html> element (or HTML root element) represents the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element.") tag and the closing `</html>` tag. The [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html "The HTML <html> element (or HTML root element) represents the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element.") element is also known as the root element. (Note however that complex documents may also have special "child" roots called [shadow-roots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot).)

### Attributes

Most elements need, or can have, additional information specified in order to function properly, or as intended. These details are given via special _name_="_value"_ pairs called attributes, and are included in the opening tag of the element. Each element or element-type has its own set of [allowed attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), (See desired element for its specific list), but there are also general or ["global" attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) that can be applied to ANY element (though some may have no effect.) Note that attribute values should be in quotes (and MUST be to properly function if value contains any whitespace -- for example, a [class-list)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) but there is usually no error message generated if quotes are missing. Note also that there is usually no error generated by misspelled or undefined attributes (though they do violate the formal spec), and thus some complex HTML documents may make use of their own private attribute-names in handling their data and elements.

## Basic syntax

<pre><strong>&lt;</strong><em>tagname</em> <em>attribute1</em> <strong>=</strong> <strong>&quot;</strong><em>value</em><strong>&quot;</strong> ... <em>attributeN</em> <strong>=</strong> <strong>&quot;</strong><em>value</em><strong>&quot;&gt;</strong> <em>element</em> <em>contents</em> <strong>&lt;/</strong><code><em>tagname</em><strong>&gt;</strong></code>
</pre>

## Main root

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html "The HTML <html> element (or HTML root element) represents the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element.") | The **HTML `<html>` element** (or _HTML root element_) represents the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element. |

## Document metadata

Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software ([search engines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/search_engine "search engines: A search engine is a software system that collects information from the World Wide Web and presents it to users who are looking for specific information."), [browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser "browsers: A Web browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks."), etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information.

| [`<style>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style "The HTML <style> element contains style information for a document, or part of a document. By default, the style instructions written inside that element are expected to be CSS.") | The **HTML `<style>` element** contains style information for a document, or part of a document.

It can only contain text, and any contained tags are ignored. |

## Content sectioning

Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Web Components

Web Components is an HTML-related technology which makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.
**Note:** The elements for Web Components are defined in the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C "World Wide Web Consortium: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international body that maintains Web-related rules and frameworks.") (W3C) [Web Components collection of specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) rather than the HTML specification. In addition, the Web Components specification has not been finalized and is subject to change.
