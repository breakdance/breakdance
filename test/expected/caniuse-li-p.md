* You can import usage data from your **Google Analytics** account and see exactly how well a feature is supported among your own site's visitors. Look under the **Settings panel** to get started!
* Usage data for all countries and continents can be imported via the **Settings panel**.
* By default, older browser versions are only shown if they have >= 0.5% usage share. You can increase or decrease this value from the **Settings panel**.
* If a feature you're looking for is not available on the site, you can [vote to have it included](https://github.com/fyrd/caniuse/issues). Better yet, if you've done the research you can even [submit it yourself](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-feature)!
* Each feature support table includes a "Usage relative" button. This will resize each browser version cell to be relative to the amount of support it has for the selected usage source.
