<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>I. Laying Plans</B>

<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  The art of war is of vital importance
<A NAME="12"></A>to the State.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety
<A NAME="14"></A>or to ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
<A NAME="15"></A>neglected.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors,
<A NAME="17"></A>to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine
<A NAME="18"></A>the conditions obtaining in the field.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> These are:  (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth;
<A NAME="20"></A>(4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>5,6.</B> The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord
<A NAME="22"></A>with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,
<A NAME="23"></A>undismayed by any danger.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times
<A NAME="25"></A>and seasons.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and
<A NAME="27"></A>security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and
<A NAME="28"></A>death.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely,
<A NAME="30"></A>benevolence, courage and strictness.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling
<A NAME="32"></A>of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the
<A NAME="33"></A>officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army,
<A NAME="34"></A>and the control of military expenditure.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> These five heads should be familiar to every general:
<A NAME="36"></A>he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will
<A NAME="37"></A>fail.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine
<A NAME="39"></A>the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in
<A NAME="40"></A>this wise:--
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral
<A NAME="42"></A>law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie
<A NAME="43"></A>the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline
<A NAME="44"></A>most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side
<A NAME="45"></A>are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the
<A NAME="46"></A>greater constancy both in reward and punishment?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> By means of these seven considerations I can forecast
<A NAME="48"></A>victory or defeat.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon
<A NAME="50"></A>it, will conquer:  let such a one be retained in command! The general that
<A NAME="51"></A>hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such
<A NAME="52"></A>a one be dismissed!
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself
<A NAME="54"></A>also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary
<A NAME="55"></A>rules.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> According as circumstances are favorable, one should
<A NAME="57"></A>modify one's plans.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> All warfare is based on deception.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when
<A NAME="60"></A>using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make
<A NAME="61"></A>the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe
<A NAME="62"></A>we are near.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> Hold out baits to entice the enemy.  Feign disorder,
<A NAME="64"></A>and crush him.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.
<A NAME="66"></A>If he is in superior strength, evade him.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate
<A NAME="68"></A>him.  Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces
<A NAME="70"></A>are united, separate them.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you
<A NAME="72"></A>are not expected.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> These military devices, leading to victory, must not
<A NAME="74"></A>be divulged beforehand.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations
<A NAME="76"></A>in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle
<A NAME="77"></A>makes but few calculations beforehand.  Thus do many calculations lead
<A NAME="78"></A>to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation
<A NAME="79"></A>at all!  It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely
<A NAME="80"></A>to win or lose.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>II. Waging War</B>

<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  In the operations of war, where there
<A NAME="83"></A>are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and
<A NAME="84"></A>a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry
<A NAME="85"></A>them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including
<A NAME="86"></A>entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent
<A NAME="87"></A>on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver
<A NAME="88"></A>per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000
<A NAME="89"></A>men.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long
<A NAME="91"></A>in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped.
<A NAME="92"></A> If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of
<A NAME="94"></A>the State will not be equal to the strain.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped,
<A NAME="96"></A>your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will
<A NAME="97"></A>spring up to take advantage of your extremity.  Then no man, however wise,
<A NAME="98"></A>will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness
<A NAME="100"></A>has never been seen associated with long delays.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> There is no instance of a country having benefited from
<A NAME="102"></A>prolonged warfare.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the
<A NAME="104"></A>evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying
<A NAME="105"></A>it on.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither
<A NAME="107"></A>are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Bring war material with you from home, but forage on
<A NAME="109"></A>the enemy.  Thus the army will have food enough for its
<A NAME="110"></A>needs.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be
<A NAME="112"></A>maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an
<A NAME="113"></A>army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices
<A NAME="115"></A>to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained
<A NAME="116"></A>away.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> When their substance is drained away, the peasantry
<A NAME="118"></A>will be afflicted by heavy exactions.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>13,14.</B> With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength,
<A NAME="120"></A>the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their
<A NAME="121"></A>income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots,
<A NAME="122"></A>worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and
<A NAME="123"></A>shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount
<A NAME="124"></A>to four-tenths of its total revenue.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the
<A NAME="126"></A>enemy.  One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty
<A NAME="127"></A>of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent
<A NAME="128"></A>to twenty from one's own store.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused
<A NAME="130"></A>to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must
<A NAME="131"></A>have their rewards.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots
<A NAME="133"></A>have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags
<A NAME="134"></A>should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled
<A NAME="135"></A>and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly
<A NAME="136"></A>treated and kept.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's
<A NAME="138"></A>own strength.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> In war, then, let your great object be victory, not
<A NAME="140"></A>lengthy campaigns.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the
<A NAME="142"></A>arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation
<A NAME="143"></A>shall be in peace or in peril.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>III. Attack by Stratagem</B>

<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  In the practical art of war, the best
<A NAME="146"></A>thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter
<A NAME="147"></A>and destroy it is not so good.  So, too, it is better to recapture an army
<A NAME="148"></A>entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company
<A NAME="149"></A>entire than to destroy them.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not
<A NAME="151"></A>supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's
<A NAME="152"></A>resistance without fighting.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's
<A NAME="154"></A>plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces;
<A NAME="155"></A>the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst
<A NAME="156"></A>policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly
<A NAME="158"></A>be avoided.  The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various
<A NAME="159"></A>implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of
<A NAME="160"></A>mounds over against the walls will take three months
<A NAME="161"></A>more.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch
<A NAME="163"></A>his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third
<A NAME="164"></A>of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.  Such are the
<A NAME="165"></A>disastrous effects of a siege.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops
<A NAME="167"></A>without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to
<A NAME="168"></A>them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the
<A NAME="169"></A>field.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of
<A NAME="171"></A>the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
<A NAME="172"></A> This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's
<A NAME="174"></A>one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous,
<A NAME="175"></A>to divide our army into two.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly
<A NAME="177"></A>inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every
<A NAME="178"></A>way, we can flee from him.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small
<A NAME="180"></A>force, in the end it must be captured by the larger
<A NAME="181"></A>force.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the
<A NAME="183"></A>bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark
<A NAME="184"></A>is defective, the State will be weak.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune
<A NAME="186"></A>upon his army:--
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat,
<A NAME="188"></A>being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling
<A NAME="189"></A>the army.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way
<A NAME="191"></A>as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain
<A NAME="192"></A>in an army.  This causes restlessness in the soldier's
<A NAME="193"></A>minds.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,
<A NAME="195"></A>through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
<A NAME="196"></A>This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble
<A NAME="198"></A>is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing
<A NAME="199"></A>anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Thus we may know that there are five essentials for
<A NAME="201"></A>victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
<A NAME="202"></A>(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
<A NAME="203"></A>(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all
<A NAME="204"></A>its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy
<A NAME="205"></A>unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered
<A NAME="206"></A>with by the sovereign.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and know yourself,
<A NAME="208"></A>you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.  If you know yourself
<A NAME="209"></A>but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
<A NAME="210"></A>If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every
<A NAME="211"></A>battle.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>IV. Tactical Dispositions</B>

<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  The good fighters of old first put themselves
<A NAME="214"></A>beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of
<A NAME="215"></A>defeating the enemy.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands,
<A NAME="217"></A>but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy
<A NAME="218"></A>himself.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against
<A NAME="220"></A>defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Hence the saying:  One may know how to conquer without
<A NAME="222"></A>being able to do it.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability
<A NAME="224"></A>to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;
<A NAME="226"></A>attacking, a superabundance of strength.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most
<A NAME="228"></A>secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth
<A NAME="229"></A>from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability
<A NAME="230"></A>to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is
<A NAME="231"></A>complete.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> To see victory only when it is within the ken of the
<A NAME="233"></A>common herd is not the acme of excellence.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and
<A NAME="235"></A>conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;
<A NAME="237"></A>to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of
<A NAME="238"></A>thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who
<A NAME="240"></A>not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for
<A NAME="242"></A>wisdom nor credit for courage.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no
<A NAME="244"></A>mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering
<A NAME="245"></A>an enemy that is already defeated.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position
<A NAME="247"></A>which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating
<A NAME="248"></A>the enemy.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only
<A NAME="250"></A>seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined
<A NAME="251"></A>to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and
<A NAME="253"></A>strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control
<A NAME="254"></A>success.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;
<A NAME="256"></A>secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing
<A NAME="257"></A>of chances; fifthly, Victory.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation
<A NAME="259"></A>of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing
<A NAME="260"></A>of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of
<A NAME="261"></A>chances.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's
<A NAME="263"></A>weight placed in the scale against a single grain.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting
<A NAME="265"></A>of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>V. Energy</B>

<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  The control of a large force is the same
<A NAME="268"></A>principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing
<A NAME="269"></A>up their numbers.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise
<A NAME="271"></A>different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting
<A NAME="272"></A>signs and signals.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt
<A NAME="274"></A>of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers
<A NAME="275"></A>direct and indirect.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone
<A NAME="277"></A>dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and
<A NAME="278"></A>strong.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining
<A NAME="280"></A>battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure
<A NAME="281"></A>victory.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible
<A NAME="283"></A>as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the
<A NAME="284"></A>sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass
<A NAME="285"></A>away to return once more.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations
<A NAME="287"></A>of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be
<A NAME="288"></A>heard.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow,
<A NAME="290"></A>red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than
<A NAME="291"></A>can ever been seen.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid,
<A NAME="293"></A>salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than
<A NAME="294"></A>can ever be tasted.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the
<A NAME="296"></A>direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless
<A NAME="297"></A>series of maneuvers.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in
<A NAME="299"></A>turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can
<A NAME="300"></A>exhaust the possibilities of their combination?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which
<A NAME="302"></A>will even roll stones along in its course.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop
<A NAME="304"></A>of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its
<A NAME="305"></A>victim.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset,
<A NAME="307"></A>and prompt in his decision.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
<A NAME="309"></A>decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be
<A NAME="311"></A>seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos,
<A NAME="312"></A>your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against
<A NAME="313"></A>defeat.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated
<A NAME="315"></A>fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates
<A NAME="316"></A>strength.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply
<A NAME="318"></A>a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity
<A NAME="319"></A>presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is
<A NAME="320"></A>to be effected by tactical dispositions.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the
<A NAME="322"></A>move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will
<A NAME="323"></A>act.  He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at
<A NAME="324"></A>it.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then
<A NAME="326"></A>with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined
<A NAME="328"></A>energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability
<A NAME="329"></A>to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become
<A NAME="331"></A>as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a
<A NAME="332"></A>log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on
<A NAME="333"></A>a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,
<A NAME="334"></A>to go rolling down.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as
<A NAME="336"></A>the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet
<A NAME="337"></A>in height.  So much on the subject of energy.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>VI. Weak Points and Strong</B>

<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  Whoever is first in the field and awaits
<A NAME="340"></A>the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second
<A NAME="341"></A>in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive
<A NAME="342"></A>exhausted.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the
<A NAME="344"></A>enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on
<A NAME="345"></A>him.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy
<A NAME="347"></A>to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it
<A NAME="348"></A>impossible for the enemy to draw near.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if
<A NAME="350"></A>well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he
<A NAME="351"></A>can force him to move.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend;
<A NAME="353"></A>march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> An army may march great distances without distress, if
<A NAME="355"></A>it marches through country where the enemy is not.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you
<A NAME="357"></A>only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your
<A NAME="358"></A>defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent
<A NAME="360"></A>does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent
<A NAME="361"></A>does not know what to attack.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!  Through you we
<A NAME="363"></A>learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the
<A NAME="364"></A>enemy's fate in our hands.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you
<A NAME="366"></A>make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit
<A NAME="367"></A>if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement
<A NAME="369"></A>even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.  All
<A NAME="370"></A>we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to
<A NAME="371"></A>relieve.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy
<A NAME="373"></A>from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced
<A NAME="374"></A>out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable
<A NAME="375"></A>in his way.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining
<A NAME="377"></A>invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's
<A NAME="378"></A>must be divided.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> We can form a single united body, while the enemy must
<A NAME="380"></A>split up into fractions.  Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate
<A NAME="381"></A>parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's
<A NAME="382"></A>few.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force
<A NAME="384"></A>with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known;
<A NAME="386"></A>for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several
<A NAME="387"></A>different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions,
<A NAME="388"></A>the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately
<A NAME="389"></A>few.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken
<A NAME="391"></A>his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should
<A NAME="392"></A>he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen
<A NAME="393"></A>his right, he will weaken his left.  If he sends reinforcements everywhere,
<A NAME="394"></A>he will everywhere be weak.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against
<A NAME="396"></A>possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to
<A NAME="397"></A>make these preparations against us.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle,
<A NAME="399"></A>we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to
<A NAME="400"></A>fight.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> But if neither time nor place be known, then the left
<A NAME="402"></A>wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to
<A NAME="403"></A>succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support
<A NAME="404"></A>the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything
<A NAME="405"></A>under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several
<A NAME="406"></A>LI!
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh
<A NAME="408"></A>exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter
<A NAME="409"></A>of victory.  I say then that victory can be achieved.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent
<A NAME="411"></A>him from fighting.  Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood
<A NAME="412"></A>of their success.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or
<A NAME="414"></A>inactivity.  Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable
<A NAME="415"></A>spots.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so
<A NAME="417"></A>that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is
<A NAME="418"></A>deficient.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you
<A NAME="420"></A>can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will
<A NAME="421"></A>be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of
<A NAME="422"></A>the wisest brains.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's
<A NAME="424"></A>own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what
<A NAME="426"></A>none can see is the strategy out of which victory is
<A NAME="427"></A>evolved.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one
<A NAME="429"></A>victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of
<A NAME="430"></A>circumstances.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its
<A NAME="432"></A>natural course runs away from high places and hastens
<A NAME="433"></A>downwards.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to
<A NAME="435"></A>strike at what is weak.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> Water shapes its course according to the nature of the
<A NAME="437"></A>ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation
<A NAME="438"></A>to the foe whom he is facing.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape,
<A NAME="440"></A>so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent
<A NAME="442"></A>and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born
<A NAME="443"></A>captain.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth)
<A NAME="445"></A>are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each
<A NAME="446"></A>other in turn.  There are short days and long; the moon has its periods
<A NAME="447"></A>of waning and waxing.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR><B>VII. Maneuvering</B>

<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  In war, the general receives his commands
<A NAME="450"></A>from the sovereign.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Having collected an army and concentrated his forces,
<A NAME="452"></A>he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching
<A NAME="453"></A>his camp.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there
<A NAME="455"></A>is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists
<A NAME="456"></A>in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into
<A NAME="457"></A>gain.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing
<A NAME="459"></A>the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to
<A NAME="460"></A>reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of
<A NAME="461"></A>deviation.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined
<A NAME="463"></A>multitude, most dangerous.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to
<A NAME="465"></A>snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.  On the
<A NAME="466"></A>other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice
<A NAME="467"></A>of its baggage and stores.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats,
<A NAME="469"></A>and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the
<A NAME="470"></A>usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage,
<A NAME="471"></A>the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the
<A NAME="472"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will
<A NAME="474"></A>fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its
<A NAME="475"></A>destination.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy,
<A NAME="477"></A>you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force
<A NAME="478"></A>will reach the goal.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds
<A NAME="480"></A>of your army will arrive.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train
<A NAME="482"></A>is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is
<A NAME="483"></A>lost.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted
<A NAME="485"></A>with the designs of our neighbors.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we
<A NAME="487"></A>are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its
<A NAME="488"></A>pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account
<A NAME="490"></A>unless we make use of local guides.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> In war, practice dissimulation, and you will
<A NAME="492"></A>succeed.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must
<A NAME="494"></A>be decided by circumstances.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness
<A NAME="496"></A>that of the forest.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability
<A NAME="498"></A>like a mountain.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and
<A NAME="500"></A>when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided
<A NAME="502"></A>amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments
<A NAME="503"></A>for the benefit of the soldiery.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> Ponder and deliberate before you make a
<A NAME="505"></A>move.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.
<A NAME="507"></A> Such is the art of maneuvering.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> The Book of Army Management says:  On the field of battle,
<A NAME="509"></A>the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs
<A NAME="510"></A>and drums.  Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough:  hence the
<A NAME="511"></A>institution of banners and flags.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby
<A NAME="513"></A>the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular
<A NAME="514"></A>point.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible
<A NAME="516"></A>either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.
<A NAME="517"></A> This is the art of handling large masses of men.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires
<A NAME="519"></A>and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of
<A NAME="520"></A>influencing the ears and eyes of your army.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief
<A NAME="522"></A>may be robbed of his presence of mind.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by
<A NAME="524"></A>noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only
<A NAME="525"></A>on returning to camp.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its
<A NAME="527"></A>spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.
<A NAME="528"></A> This is the art of studying moods.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder
<A NAME="530"></A>and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining
<A NAME="531"></A>self-possession.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from
<A NAME="533"></A>it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed
<A NAME="534"></A>while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's
<A NAME="535"></A>strength.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners
<A NAME="537"></A>are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm
<A NAME="538"></A>and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against
<A NAME="540"></A>the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not
<A NAME="542"></A>attack soldiers whose temper is keen.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>35.</B> Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere
<A NAME="544"></A>with an army that is returning home.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR><B>36.</B> When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do
<A NAME="546"></A>not press a desperate foe too hard.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR><B>37.</B> Such is the art of warfare.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>VIII. Variation in Tactics</B>

<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  In war, the general receives his commands
<A NAME="550"></A>from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his
<A NAME="551"></A>forces
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> When in difficult country, do not encamp.  In country
<A NAME="553"></A>where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger
<A NAME="554"></A>in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort
<A NAME="555"></A>to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> There are roads which must not be followed, armies which
<A NAME="557"></A>must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must
<A NAME="558"></A>not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be
<A NAME="559"></A>obeyed.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The general who thoroughly understands the advantages
<A NAME="561"></A>that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his
<A NAME="562"></A>troops.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> The general who does not understand these, may be well
<A NAME="564"></A>acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able
<A NAME="565"></A>to turn his knowledge to practical account.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of
<A NAME="567"></A>war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages,
<A NAME="568"></A>will fail to make the best use of his men.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage
<A NAME="570"></A>and of disadvantage will be blended together.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way,
<A NAME="572"></A>we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our
<A NAME="573"></A>schemes.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we
<A NAME="575"></A>are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from
<A NAME="576"></A>misfortune.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;
<A NAME="578"></A>and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious
<A NAME="579"></A>allurements, and make them rush to any given point.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood
<A NAME="581"></A>of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not
<A NAME="582"></A>on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have
<A NAME="583"></A>made our position unassailable.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:
<A NAME="585"></A>(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads
<A NAME="586"></A>to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a
<A NAME="587"></A>delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for
<A NAME="588"></A>his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous
<A NAME="590"></A>to the conduct of war.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the
<A NAME="592"></A>cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults.  Let them
<A NAME="593"></A>be a subject of meditation.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>IX.  The Army on the March</B>

<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  We come now to the question of encamping
<A NAME="596"></A>the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains,
<A NAME="597"></A>and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Camp in high places, facing the sun.  Do not climb heights
<A NAME="599"></A>in order to fight.  So much for mountain warfare.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> After crossing a river, you should get far away from
<A NAME="601"></A>it.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> When an invading force crosses a river in its onward
<A NAME="603"></A>march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let
<A NAME="604"></A>half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet
<A NAME="606"></A>the invader near a river which he has to cross.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing
<A NAME="608"></A>the sun.  Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river
<A NAME="609"></A>warfare.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be
<A NAME="611"></A>to get over them quickly, without any delay.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water
<A NAME="613"></A>and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.  So much for
<A NAME="614"></A>operations in salt-marches.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position
<A NAME="616"></A>with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may
<A NAME="617"></A>be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat
<A NAME="618"></A>country.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> These are the four useful branches of military knowledge
<A NAME="620"></A>which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several
<A NAME="621"></A>sovereigns.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places
<A NAME="623"></A>to dark.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground,
<A NAME="625"></A>the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell
<A NAME="626"></A>victory.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny
<A NAME="628"></A>side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for
<A NAME="629"></A>the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the
<A NAME="630"></A>ground.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river
<A NAME="632"></A>which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait
<A NAME="633"></A>until it subsides.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents
<A NAME="635"></A>running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets,
<A NAME="636"></A>quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not
<A NAME="637"></A>approached.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> While we keep away from such places, we should get the
<A NAME="639"></A>enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have
<A NAME="640"></A>them on his rear.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be
<A NAME="642"></A>any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled
<A NAME="643"></A>with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed
<A NAME="644"></A>out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious
<A NAME="645"></A>spies are likely to be lurking.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he
<A NAME="647"></A>is relying on the natural strength of his position.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he
<A NAME="649"></A>is anxious for the other side to advance.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is
<A NAME="651"></A>tendering a bait.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the
<A NAME="653"></A>enemy is advancing.  The appearance of a number of screens in the midst
<A NAME="654"></A>of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us
<A NAME="655"></A>suspicious.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an
<A NAME="657"></A>ambuscade.  Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is
<A NAME="658"></A>coming.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the
<A NAME="660"></A>sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide
<A NAME="661"></A>area, it betokens the approach of infantry.  When it branches out in different
<A NAME="662"></A>directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A
<A NAME="663"></A>few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is
<A NAME="664"></A>encamping.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Humble words and increased preparations are signs that
<A NAME="666"></A>the enemy is about to advance.  Violent language and driving forward as
<A NAME="667"></A>if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> When the light chariots come out first and take up a
<A NAME="669"></A>position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for
<A NAME="670"></A>battle.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate
<A NAME="672"></A>a plot.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> When there is much running about and the soldiers fall
<A NAME="674"></A>into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it
<A NAME="676"></A>is a lure.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they
<A NAME="678"></A>are faint from want of food.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking
<A NAME="680"></A>themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes
<A NAME="682"></A>no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor
<A NAME="684"></A>by night betokens nervousness.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority
<A NAME="686"></A>is weak.  If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot.
<A NAME="687"></A> If the officers are angry, it means that the men are
<A NAME="688"></A>weary.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its
<A NAME="690"></A>cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the
<A NAME="691"></A>camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know
<A NAME="692"></A>that they are determined to fight to the death.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR><B>35.</B> The sight of men whispering together in small knots
<A NAME="694"></A>or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and
<A NAME="695"></A>file.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR><B>36.</B> Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the
<A NAME="697"></A>end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire
<A NAME="698"></A>distress.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR><B>37.</B> To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at
<A NAME="700"></A>the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR><B>38.</B> When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths,
<A NAME="702"></A>it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>39.</B> If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing
<A NAME="704"></A>ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves
<A NAME="705"></A>off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and
<A NAME="706"></A>circumspection.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR><B>40.</B> If our troops are no more in number than the enemy,
<A NAME="708"></A>that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.
<A NAME="709"></A> What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep
<A NAME="710"></A>a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR><B>41.</B> He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his
<A NAME="712"></A>opponents is sure to be captured by them.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>42.</B> If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached
<A NAME="714"></A>to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will
<A NAME="715"></A>be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,
<A NAME="716"></A>punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR><B>43.</B> Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance
<A NAME="718"></A>with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.  This
<A NAME="719"></A>is a certain road to victory.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR><B>44.</B> If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced,
<A NAME="721"></A>the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be
<A NAME="722"></A>bad.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR><B>45.</B> If a general shows confidence in his men but always
<A NAME="724"></A>insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be
<A NAME="725"></A>mutual.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR><B>X. Terrain</B>

<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  We may distinguish six kinds of terrain,
<A NAME="728"></A>to wit:  (1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground; (3) temporizing
<A NAME="729"></A>ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a
<A NAME="730"></A>great distance from the enemy.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is
<A NAME="732"></A>called accessible.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy
<A NAME="734"></A>in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line
<A NAME="735"></A>of supplies.  Then you will be able to fight with advantage.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy
<A NAME="737"></A>is called entangling.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared,
<A NAME="739"></A>you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your
<A NAME="740"></A>coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster
<A NAME="741"></A>will ensue.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> When the position is such that neither side will gain
<A NAME="743"></A>by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should
<A NAME="745"></A>offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but
<A NAME="746"></A>rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part
<A NAME="747"></A>of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with
<A NAME="748"></A>advantage.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them
<A NAME="750"></A>first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the
<A NAME="751"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do
<A NAME="753"></A>not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly
<A NAME="754"></A>garrisoned.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand
<A NAME="756"></A>with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and
<A NAME="757"></A>there wait for him to come up.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow
<A NAME="759"></A>him, but retreat and try to entice him away.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy,
<A NAME="761"></A>and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke
<A NAME="762"></A>a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> These six are the principles connected with Earth. The
<A NAME="764"></A>general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study
<A NAME="765"></A>them.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not
<A NAME="767"></A>arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.
<A NAME="768"></A> These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5)
<A NAME="769"></A>disorganization; (6) rout.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled
<A NAME="771"></A>against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the
<A NAME="772"></A>former.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers
<A NAME="774"></A>too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong
<A NAME="775"></A>and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate,
<A NAME="777"></A>and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling
<A NAME="778"></A>of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he
<A NAME="779"></A>is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> When the general is weak and without authority; when
<A NAME="781"></A>his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned
<A NAME="782"></A>to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner,
<A NAME="783"></A>the result is utter disorganization.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength,
<A NAME="785"></A>allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment
<A NAME="786"></A>against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front
<A NAME="787"></A>rank, the result must be rout.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be
<A NAME="789"></A>carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible
<A NAME="790"></A>post.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> The natural formation of the country is the soldier's
<A NAME="792"></A>best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the
<A NAME="793"></A>forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and
<A NAME="794"></A>distances, constitutes the test of a great general.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his
<A NAME="796"></A>knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor
<A NAME="797"></A>practices them, will surely be defeated.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must
<A NAME="799"></A>fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in
<A NAME="800"></A>victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's
<A NAME="801"></A>bidding.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats
<A NAME="803"></A>without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country
<A NAME="804"></A>and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the
<A NAME="805"></A>kingdom.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will
<A NAME="807"></A>follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved
<A NAME="808"></A>sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your
<A NAME="810"></A>authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and
<A NAME="811"></A>incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened
<A NAME="812"></A>to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical
<A NAME="813"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack,
<A NAME="815"></A>but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only
<A NAME="816"></A>halfway towards victory.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are
<A NAME="818"></A>unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone
<A NAME="819"></A>only halfway towards victory.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also
<A NAME="821"></A>know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the
<A NAME="822"></A>nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only
<A NAME="823"></A>halfway towards victory.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never
<A NAME="825"></A>bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a
<A NAME="826"></A>loss.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and know yourself,
<A NAME="828"></A>your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth,
<A NAME="829"></A>you may make your victory complete.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR><B>XI. The Nine Situations</B>

<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  The art of war recognizes nine varieties
<A NAME="832"></A>of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground;
<A NAME="833"></A>(4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground;
<A NAME="834"></A>(7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate
<A NAME="835"></A>ground.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it
<A NAME="837"></A>is dispersive ground.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to
<A NAME="839"></A>no great distance, it is facile ground.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Ground the possession of which imports great advantage
<A NAME="841"></A>to either side, is contentious ground.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is
<A NAME="843"></A>open ground.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,
<A NAME="845"></A>so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,
<A NAME="846"></A>is a ground of intersecting highways.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile
<A NAME="848"></A>country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious
<A NAME="849"></A>ground.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all
<A NAME="851"></A>country that is hard to traverse:  this is difficult
<A NAME="852"></A>ground.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from
<A NAME="854"></A>which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the
<A NAME="855"></A>enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men:  this is hemmed in
<A NAME="856"></A>ground.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction
<A NAME="858"></A>by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile
<A NAME="860"></A>ground, halt not.  On contentious ground, attack not.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way.
<A NAME="862"></A>On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your
<A NAME="863"></A>allies.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground,
<A NAME="865"></A>keep steadily on the march.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate
<A NAME="867"></A>ground, fight.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how
<A NAME="869"></A>to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation
<A NAME="870"></A>between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing
<A NAME="871"></A>the bad, the officers from rallying their men.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep
<A NAME="873"></A>them in disorder.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> When it was to their advantage, they made a forward
<A NAME="875"></A>move; when otherwise, they stopped still.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy
<A NAME="877"></A>in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say:
<A NAME="878"></A> "Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will
<A NAME="879"></A>be amenable to your will."
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Rapidity is the essence of war:  take advantage of the
<A NAME="881"></A>enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded
<A NAME="882"></A>spots.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> The following are the principles to be observed by an
<A NAME="884"></A>invading force:  The further you penetrate into a country, the greater
<A NAME="885"></A>will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not
<A NAME="886"></A>prevail against you.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your
<A NAME="888"></A>army with food.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not
<A NAME="890"></A>overtax them.  Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.  Keep your
<A NAME="891"></A>army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable
<A NAME="892"></A>plans.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no
<A NAME="894"></A>escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death,
<A NAME="895"></A>there is nothing they may not achieve.  Officers and men alike will put
<A NAME="896"></A>forth their uttermost strength.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of
<A NAME="898"></A>fear.  If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm.  If they are
<A NAME="899"></A>in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front.  If there is no help
<A NAME="900"></A>for it, they will fight hard.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers
<A NAME="902"></A>will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will
<A NAME="903"></A>do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving
<A NAME="904"></A>orders, they can be trusted.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious
<A NAME="906"></A>doubts.  Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be
<A NAME="907"></A>feared.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it
<A NAME="909"></A>is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not
<A NAME="910"></A>unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to
<A NAME="911"></A>longevity.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers
<A NAME="913"></A>may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down
<A NAME="914"></A>letting the tears run down their cheeks.  But let them once be brought
<A NAME="915"></A>to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a
<A NAME="916"></A>Kuei.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan.
<A NAME="918"></A>Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains.  Strike
<A NAME="919"></A>at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail,
<A NAME="920"></A>and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will
<A NAME="921"></A>be attacked by head and tail both.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan,
<A NAME="923"></A>I should answer, Yes.  For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies;
<A NAME="924"></A>yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm,
<A NAME="925"></A>they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the
<A NAME="926"></A>right.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering
<A NAME="928"></A>of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the
<A NAME="929"></A>ground
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> The principle on which to manage an army is to set up
<A NAME="931"></A>one standard of courage which all must reach.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is
<A NAME="933"></A>a question involving the proper use of ground.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as
<A NAME="935"></A>though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the
<A NAME="936"></A>hand.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR><B>35.</B> It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus
<A NAME="938"></A>ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain
<A NAME="939"></A>order.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR><B>36.</B> He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false
<A NAME="941"></A>reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total
<A NAME="942"></A>ignorance.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR><B>37.</B> By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,
<A NAME="944"></A>he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and
<A NAME="945"></A>taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his
<A NAME="946"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR><B>38.</B> At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like
<A NAME="948"></A>one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.
<A NAME="949"></A> He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his
<A NAME="950"></A>hand.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR><B>39.</B> He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like
<A NAME="952"></A>a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that,
<A NAME="953"></A>and nothing knows whither he is going.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR><B>40.</B> To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may
<A NAME="955"></A>be termed the business of the general.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR><B>41.</B> The different measures suited to the nine varieties
<A NAME="957"></A>of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental
<A NAME="958"></A>laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be
<A NAME="959"></A>studied.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR><B>42.</B> When invading hostile territory, the general principle
<A NAME="961"></A>is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way
<A NAME="962"></A>means dispersion.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR><B>43.</B> When you leave your own country behind, and take your
<A NAME="964"></A>army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.
<A NAME="965"></A> When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is
<A NAME="966"></A>one of intersecting highways.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR><B>44.</B> When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious
<A NAME="968"></A>ground.  When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile
<A NAME="969"></A>ground.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR><B>45.</B> When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear,
<A NAME="971"></A>and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place
<A NAME="972"></A>of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR><B>46.</B> Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my
<A NAME="974"></A>men with unity of purpose.  On facile ground, I would see that there is
<A NAME="975"></A>close connection between all parts of my army.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR><B>47.</B> On contentious ground, I would hurry up my
<A NAME="977"></A>rear.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR><B>48.</B> On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses.
<A NAME="979"></A> On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my
<A NAME="980"></A>alliances.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>49.</B> On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous
<A NAME="982"></A>stream of supplies.  On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along
<A NAME="983"></A>the road.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR><B>50.</B> On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.
<A NAME="985"></A> On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness
<A NAME="986"></A>of saving their lives.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR><B>51.</B> For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate
<A NAME="988"></A>resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,
<A NAME="989"></A>and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR><B>52.</B> We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes
<A NAME="991"></A>until we are acquainted with their designs.  We are not fit to lead an
<A NAME="992"></A>army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its
<A NAME="993"></A>mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
<A NAME="994"></A>We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make
<A NAME="995"></A>use of local guides.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR><B>53.</B> To be ignored of any one of the following four or five
<A NAME="997"></A>principles does not befit a warlike prince.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR><B>54.</B> When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his
<A NAME="999"></A>generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's
<A NAME="1000"></A>forces.  He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from
<A NAME="1001"></A>joining against him.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR><B>55.</B> Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and
<A NAME="1003"></A>sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his
<A NAME="1004"></A>own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe.  Thus he is able to
<A NAME="1005"></A>capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR><B>56.</B> Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders
<A NAME="1007"></A>without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle
<A NAME="1008"></A>a whole army as though you had to do with but a single
<A NAME="1009"></A>man.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR><B>57.</B> Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let
<A NAME="1011"></A>them know your design.  When the outlook is bright, bring it before their
<A NAME="1012"></A>eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR><B>58.</B> Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive;
<A NAME="1014"></A>plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in
<A NAME="1015"></A>safety.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR><B>59.</B> For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's
<A NAME="1017"></A>way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR><B>60.</B> Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating
<A NAME="1019"></A>ourselves to the enemy's purpose.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR><B>61.</B> By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall
<A NAME="1021"></A>succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR><B>62.</B> This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer
<A NAME="1023"></A>cunning.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR><B>63.</B> On the day that you take up your command, block the
<A NAME="1025"></A>frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of
<A NAME="1026"></A>all emissaries.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR><B>64.</B> Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control
<A NAME="1028"></A>the situation.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR><B>65.</B> If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush
<A NAME="1030"></A>in.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR><B>66.</B> Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,
<A NAME="1032"></A>and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR><B>67.</B> Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself
<A NAME="1034"></A>to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR><B>68.</B> At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until
<A NAME="1036"></A>the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running
<A NAME="1037"></A>hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose
<A NAME="1038"></A>you.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR><B>XII. The Attack by Fire</B>

<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  There are five ways of attacking with
<A NAME="1041"></A>fire.  The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn
<A NAME="1042"></A>stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals
<A NAME="1043"></A>and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the
<A NAME="1044"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.
<A NAME="1046"></A> The material for raising fire should always be kept in
<A NAME="1047"></A>readiness.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> There is a proper season for making attacks with fire,
<A NAME="1049"></A>and special days for starting a conflagration.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the
<A NAME="1051"></A>special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve,
<A NAME="1052"></A>the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising
<A NAME="1053"></A>wind.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet
<A NAME="1055"></A>five possible developments:
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond
<A NAME="1057"></A>at once with an attack from without.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's
<A NAME="1059"></A>soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height,
<A NAME="1061"></A>follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where
<A NAME="1062"></A>you are.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from
<A NAME="1064"></A>without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack
<A NAME="1065"></A>at a favorable moment.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do
<A NAME="1067"></A>not attack from the leeward.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night
<A NAME="1069"></A>breeze soon falls.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> In every army, the five developments connected with
<A NAME="1071"></A>fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch
<A NAME="1072"></A>kept for the proper days.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show
<A NAME="1074"></A>intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession
<A NAME="1075"></A>of strength.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but
<A NAME="1077"></A>not robbed of all his belongings.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles
<A NAME="1079"></A>and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise;
<A NAME="1080"></A>for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> Hence the saying:  The enlightened ruler lays his plans
<A NAME="1082"></A>well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops
<A NAME="1084"></A>unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is
<A NAME="1085"></A>critical.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> No ruler should put troops into the field merely to
<A NAME="1087"></A>gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of
<A NAME="1088"></A>pique.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if
<A NAME="1090"></A>not, stay where you are.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be
<A NAME="1092"></A>succeeded by content.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never
<A NAME="1094"></A>come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to
<A NAME="1095"></A>life.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good
<A NAME="1097"></A>general full of caution.  This is the way to keep a country at peace and
<A NAME="1098"></A>an army intact.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>XIII. The Use of Spies</B>

<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sun Tzu said:  Raising a host of a hundred thousand men
<A NAME="1101"></A>and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and
<A NAME="1102"></A>a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount
<A NAME="1103"></A>to a thousand ounces of silver.  There will be commotion at home and abroad,
<A NAME="1104"></A>and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred
<A NAME="1105"></A>thousand families will be impeded in their labor.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving
<A NAME="1107"></A>for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain
<A NAME="1108"></A>in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay
<A NAME="1109"></A>of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of
<A NAME="1110"></A>inhumanity.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help
<A NAME="1112"></A>to his sovereign, no master of victory.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general
<A NAME="1114"></A>to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary
<A NAME="1115"></A>men, is foreknowledge.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits;
<A NAME="1117"></A>it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive
<A NAME="1118"></A>calculation.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained
<A NAME="1120"></A>from other men.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes:
<A NAME="1122"></A>(1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies;
<A NAME="1123"></A>(5) surviving spies.
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can
<A NAME="1125"></A>discover the secret system.  This is called "divine manipulation of the
<A NAME="1126"></A>threads."  It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Having local spies means employing the services of the
<A NAME="1128"></A>inhabitants of a district.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> Having inward spies, making use of officials of the
<A NAME="1130"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's
<A NAME="1132"></A>spies and using them for our own purposes.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for
<A NAME="1134"></A>purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report
<A NAME="1135"></A>them to the enemy.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news
<A NAME="1137"></A>from the enemy's camp.
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more
<A NAME="1139"></A>intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more
<A NAME="1140"></A>liberally rewarded.  In no other business should greater secrecy be
<A NAME="1141"></A>preserved.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain
<A NAME="1143"></A>intuitive sagacity.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> They cannot be properly managed without benevolence
<A NAME="1145"></A>and straightforwardness.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain
<A NAME="1147"></A>of the truth of their reports.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind
<A NAME="1149"></A>of business.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before
<A NAME="1151"></A>the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom
<A NAME="1152"></A>the secret was told.
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city,
<A NAME="1154"></A>or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding
<A NAME="1155"></A>out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and
<A NAME="1156"></A>sentries of the general in command.  Our spies must be commissioned to
<A NAME="1157"></A>ascertain these.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be
<A NAME="1159"></A>sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed.  Thus
<A NAME="1160"></A>they will become converted spies and available for our
<A NAME="1161"></A>service.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> It is through the information brought by the converted
<A NAME="1163"></A>spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward
<A NAME="1164"></A>spies.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause
<A NAME="1166"></A>the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving
<A NAME="1168"></A>spy can be used on appointed occasions.
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties
<A NAME="1170"></A>is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the
<A NAME="1171"></A>first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the
<A NAME="1172"></A>converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih
<A NAME="1174"></A>who had served under the Hsia.  Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty
<A NAME="1175"></A>was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise
<A NAME="1177"></A>general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes
