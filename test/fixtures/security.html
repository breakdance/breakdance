            Security
          </span></h1> <!----></div> <!----></div> <section class="content"><div><div><p>Subscribers want to know that their dependencies handle security
responsibly. We want to tell them about any vulnerabilities that
affect their dependencies, take some proactive steps to avoid
future vulnerabilities, and handle any new vulnerabilities
responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-about-historical-vulnerabilities">Tell us about historical vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>We keep a database of vulnerabilities along with affected package
versions. If you've had any security vulnerabilities in the past,
when you start lifting your package, we'd like you to tell us
about them—there's a place to do this on the <a href="/lifter">lifter
dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>We use this information to notify subscribers if they're using any
affected versions of your package.</p>
<h2 id="agree-to-use-responsible-disclosure">Agree to use responsible disclosure</h2>
<p>There are two elements of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>By agreeing to lift your package, we'd like you to agree in
principle that you'll follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsible
disclosure</a>
practices.</li>
<li>If someone reports a vulnerability to you, <em>actually</em> use a
responsible disclosure process.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ask that you add a vulnerability-reporting link and policy to
your README or project website. You can create your own process OR
you can use the Tidelift <a href="../security">reporting page</a> and
<a href="security-process">process</a>. When you start lifting a package,
we'll walk you through this in the lifter dashboard.</p>
<p>If you're creating your own process, these projects with mature,
detailed security policies might be interesting to see how other
projects handle security bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">Django</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/policies/security">npm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't want to figure out your own process, all you have to
do is link to our <a href="../security">reporting page</a>. When we get a
report, we'll reach out to you and we'll ask you to work with us
on it.</p>
<h2 id="agree-to-be-responsive-to-security-issues">Agree to be responsive to security issues</h2>
<p>We'd like you to be responsive around security issues and work to
resolve them. Not all reported issues are severe (or even real),
but it's important to assess each one and respond.</p>
<p>We aren't imposing a firm time limit or deadline, because we feel
it wouldn't be viable for smaller projects, at least not without
more support from Tidelift. However, please put security issues at
the front of your priority queue.</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-about-new-vulnerabilities">Tell us about new vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>If you're handling a responsible disclosure yourself, please enter
the new vulnerability into the lifter dashboard when it becomes
public. We'll then notify any affected subscribers.</p>
<h2 id="use-two-factor-authentication-or-at-least-unique-passwords">Use two-factor authentication (or at least unique passwords)</h2>
<p>When you agree to become a lifter, we'll ask that you enable
two-factor authentication on all sites that are involved in the
pipeline from code to package. This will protect your own
accounts, while also lowering trojan horse risks for
subscribers. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/674">This eslint
trojan</a> was an example of
the kind of problem we're trying to avoid.</p>
<p>In particular, if applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication/">Enable 2-factor auth on GitHub</a></li>
<li>Enable 2-factor auth for package publishing<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication">npm</a></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For services which do not have 2-factor authentication, please us
a strong password unique to each service (most people do this via
a password manager).</p>
<p>If you haven't, we know you've been <em>meaning</em> to set up 2-factor
authentication and strong passwords. As part of agreeing to lift
your package, we're asking you to <em>actually</em> do it.</p>
<h2 id="if-your-project-isnt-security-sensitive">If your project isn't security-sensitive…</h2>
<p>Not all projects parse untrusted input. If a given security task
doesn't apply to your project, then you wouldn't be on the hook
for that task.</p>
<p>Some security risks can affect any project, though, such as trojan
package uploads containing malware.</p>
<h2 id="future-directions">Future directions</h2>
<p>We may ask for a few more security-related tasks in the future,
subject to figuring out the details—we want to be sure the
details of these tasks are manageable for maintainers and valuable
for subscribers. These ideas may or may not happen soon,
and may or may not be part of the base lifter agreement.</p>
<p>We'd love to talk about these or your other ideas, get in touch!</p>
<h3 id="future-security-scanning-or-linting">Future: Security scanning or linting</h3>
<p>There are a number of security analysis tools which proactively
look for potential problems. We could run those regularly on
lifted projects and ask lifters to read over the report, tagging
reported issues as real or false-positives. The value to
subscribers would be to quickly detect SQL injection problems,
obvious buffer overflows, or other common mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="future-signed-packages">Future: Signed packages</h3>
<p>A simple version of this would be to require signatures, for
package managers that support it.</p>

responsibilities. <a href="tasks-overview">Return to the tasks overview.</a></p></div></div></section></div></div>
