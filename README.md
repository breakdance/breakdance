> Breakdance is a node.js library for converting HTML to markdown. Highly pluggable, flexible and easy to use. It's time for your markup to get down.

Breakdance is a node.js library for converting HTML to markdown. You can use breakdance to:

* Migrate HTML blog posts to markdown
* Convert wiki pages to markdown
* Convert HTML documentation to markdown
* Convert HTML presentations or slide decks to markdown
* Convert busy web pages into readable markdown documents.

Visit [breakdance.io](http://breakdance.io) for detailed documentation, [examples](http://breakdance.io/examples), [recipes](http://breakdance.io/recipes), and advice on [authoring and finding plugins](http://breakdance.io/plugins.html).

## What's different about breakdance?

Breakdance uses [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) to parse HTML, and [snapdragon](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/snapdragon) for rendering, which provides granular control over the entire conversion process in a way that is easy to understand, reason about, and [customize](http://breakdance.io/plugins.html).

**Generates well-formatted markdown**

* Comprehensive [HTML tag coverage](lib/compiler.js).
* Granular control over every HTML element and attributes
* Even **converts HTML tables** to markdown!

**Extremely pluggable**

Every part of the conversion is customizable:

* [options](http://breakdance.io/plugins.html) are available for customizing output of any HTML tag if you don't like the defaults
* [plugins](http://breakdance.io/plugins.html) are easy to write if you'd like to share your customizations with the world

## HTML-to-markdown example

**Tables**

The following HTML table:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Heading 1</th>
      <th>Heading 2</th>
      <th>Heading 3</th>
      <th>Heading 4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Would render to the following markdown:

```html
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 | Heading 4 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
```

See [the documentation](http://breakdance.io/examples.html) for more examples.
