> Breakdance is a node.js library for converting HTML to markdown. Highly pluggable, flexible and easy to use. It's time for your markup to get down.

Breakdance is a node.js library for converting HTML to markdown. You can use breakdance to:

* Migrate HTML blog posts to markdown
* Convert wiki pages to markdown
* Convert HTML documentation to markdown
* Convert HTML presentations or slide decks to markdown
* Convert busy web pages into readable markdown documents.

Visit [our website](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/index.html) for [detailed documentation](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/docs.html), [examples](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/examples.html), [recipes](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/recipes.html), and advice on [authoring and finding plugins](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/plugins.html).

## Why should I use breakdance?

Breakdance uses [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) to parse HTML, and [snapdragon](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/snapdragon) for rendering, which provides granular control over the entire conversion process in a way that is easy to understand, reason about, and [customize](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/plugins.html). If you see something you don't like, it's easy to change!

**Generates well-formatted markdown**

* Comprehensive [HTML tag coverage](lib/compiler.js).
* Granular control over every HTML element and attributes
* Even **converts HTML tables** to markdown!

**Extremely pluggable**

Every part of the conversion is customizable:

* [options](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/docs.html#options) are available for customizing output of any HTML tag if you don't like the defaults
* [plugins](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/plugins.html) are easy to write if you'd like to share your customizations with the world

## HTML-to-markdown example

**Tables**

The following HTML table from [bootstrap's docs](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap):

```html
<h2 id=tables-hover-rows>Hover rows</h2>
<p>Add <code>.table-hover</code> to enable a hover state on table rows within a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class=bs-example data-example-id=hoverable-table>
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>#</th>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <th>Last Name</th>
        <th>Username</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope=row>1</th>
        <td>Mark</td>
        <td>Otto</td>
        <td>@mdo</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope=row>2</th>
        <td>Jacob</td>
        <td>Thornton</td>
        <td>@fat</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope=row>3</th>
        <td>Larry</td>
        <td>the Bird</td>
        <td>@twitter</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

Would render to the following markdown:

```
## Hover rows

Add `.table-hover` to enable a hover state on table rows within a `<tbody>`.

| # | First Name | Last Name | Username |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Mark | Otto | @mdo |
| 2 | Jacob | Thornton | @fat |
| 3 | Larry | the Bird | @twitter |
```

See [the documentation](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/examples.html) for more examples.

##### [3.0.0](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/compare/2.0.0...3.0.0) - 2017-05-12

**Removed**

* CLI was externalized to [breakdance-cli][]

##### [2.0.0](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/compare/1.1.0...2.0.0) - 2017-04-25

**Changed**

* `<b>`: now renders as `**bold**`, same as `<strong>` tags
* `<i>`: now renders as `_italics_`, same as `<em>` tags

##### [1.1.0](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0) - 2017-04-21

**Fixed**

* `<code>`: improvements to whitespace handling
* `<code>`: no longer renders empty tags
* `<p>`: normalize Unicode `U+00A0` non-breaking spaces to "normal" Unicode `U+0020` spaces. Non-breaking spaces are useful in HTML, but cause flow problems in markdown.

**Added**

* documentation for `options.comments`, `options.unsmarty`, `options.trailingWhitespace`, all previously undocumented options. [See breakdance's options](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/docs.html#options)

##### [1.0.0](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/compare/0.1.5...1.0.0) - 2017-03-12

**Added**

* Adds support for `<base>`, closes [issue #3](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/issues/3)

**Changed**

* Changed the CLI command from `tomd` to either `br`. As a fallback, you can also use `breakdance` if there is a conflict. The CLI has not yet been documented, so hopefully this doesn't cause any issues for anyone.

##### [0.1.5](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/compare/0.1.4...0.1.5)

**Fixed**

* An extra trailing newline was being added on `<code>` tags

**Added**

* Adds `keepEmpty` option, to selective keep empty tags that are omitted by built-in `omitEmpty` tags
* Adds documentation for `omit`, `pick` and `omitEmpty` and `keepEmpty` options

**Changed**

* Externalized `utils.js` to [breakdance-util](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance-util), to allow plugin authors to use the same utilities as breakdance, for consistency.

##### [0.1.4](https://github.com/breakdance/breakdance/compare/0.1.0...0.1.4)

**Fixed**

* Better whitespace handling in `table`, `a` and `dl` tags

**Added**
